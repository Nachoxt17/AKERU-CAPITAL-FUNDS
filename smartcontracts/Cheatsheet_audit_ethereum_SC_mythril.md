# Solidity audit & Ethereum Smart Contract analysis using Mythril

Following last week's video, I will show how to audit and find vulnerability inside an Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity using Mythril, one of the best EVM smart contract analysis tools.

# Our target contract: `etherstore.sol`

link: https://github.com/sigp/solidity-security-blog#1-re-entrancy-1

``` js
contract EtherStore {

    uint256 public withdrawalLimit = 1 ether;
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastWithdrawTime;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function depositFunds() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdrawFunds (uint256 _weiToWithdraw) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= _weiToWithdraw);
        // limit the withdrawal
        require(_weiToWithdraw <= withdrawalLimit);
        // limit the time allowed to withdraw
        require(now >= lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] + 1 weeks);
        require(msg.sender.call.value(_weiToWithdraw)());
        balances[msg.sender] -= _weiToWithdraw;
        lastWithdrawTime[msg.sender] = now;
    }
}
```

# Mythril

Docs: https://mythril-classic.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html

Install:
``` sh
pip3 install mythril
```

**************
PyPI on Ubuntu
**************

.. code-block:: bash

   # Update
   sudo apt update

   # Install solc
   sudo apt install software-properties-common
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum
   sudo apt install solc

   # Install libssl-dev, python3-dev, and python3-pip
   sudo apt install libssl-dev python3-dev python3-pip

   # Install mythril (Always use Linux Ubuntu/WSL 2.0 If Possible)
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

   pip3 install mythril
   myth version


******
Docker
******

All Mythril releases, starting from v0.18.3, are published to DockerHub as Docker images under the :code:`mythril/myth` name.

After installing `Docker CE <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_:

   .. code-block:: bash

      # Pull the latest release of mythril/myth
      $ docker pull mythril/myth

Use :code:`docker run mythril/myth` the same way you would use the :code:`myth` command

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker run mythril/myth --help
      docker run mythril/myth disassemble -c "0x6060"

To pass a file from your host machine to the dockerized Mythril, you must mount its containing folder to the container properly. For :code:`contract.sol` in the current working directory, do:

   .. code-block:: bash

      docker run -v $(pwd):/tmp mythril/myth analyze /tmp/contract.sol


Commands:
``` sh
$ myth help

usage: myth [-h] [-v LOG_LEVEL]
            {safe-functions,analyze,a,disassemble,d,list-detectors,read-storage,function-to-hash,hash-to-address,version,help} ...

Security analysis of Ethereum smart contracts

positional arguments:

                        Commands
    safe-functions      Check functions which are completely safe using symbolic execution
    analyze (a)         Triggers the analysis of the smart contract
    disassemble (d)     Disassembles the smart contract
    list-detectors      Lists available detection modules
    read-storage        Retrieves storage slots from a given address through rpc
    function-to-hash    Returns the hash signature of the function
    hash-to-address     converts the hashes in the blockchain to ethereum address
    version             Outputs the version

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v LOG_LEVEL          log level (0-5)

```

The arithmetic operator can overflow.
It is possible to cause an integer overflow or underflow in the arithmetic operation.

A control flow decision is made based on The block.timestamp environment variable.
The block.timestamp environment variable is used to determine a control flow decision. Note that the values of variables like coinbase, gaslimit, block number and timestamp are predictable and can be manipulated by a malicious miner. Also keep in mind that attackers know hashes of earlier blocks. Don\'t use any of those environment variables as sources of randomness and be aware that use of these variables introduces a certain level of trust into miners.

A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.

Read of persistent state following external call
The contract account state is accessed after an external call to a user defined address. To prevent reentrancy issues, consider accessing the state only before the call, especially if the callee is untrusted. Alternatively, a reentrancy lock can be used to prevent untrusted callees from re-entering the contract in an intermediate state.
